									<h3>Unified Login</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Each UM student has an account and password to log in the school system. And it is also the key to the Google account. Therefore, to avoid duplicate logins on different platforms, my App "Get U M" will provide a unified login page that users can use UM web login page to log in the system. The system will automatically connect to the user's Wolverine access for the user's course schedule and import it to the Google calendar. Thus, the user will see the personal Google calendar on the screen. By clicking on the schedule, the system will direct the user to the location information. It is all-in-one, so the user will not have to jump back and forth between Wolverine access and Google Maps.</p>

									<h3>Indoor Maps</h3>
								</header>
								<p>According to the user research, the biggest problem for finding the classroom is not how to get to the building. People usually do not have problems finding directions outside. The outdoor maps are thorough to some extent with the assistance provided by Google Maps and Campus Maps. But the problem happens when students are inside the building and completely lose their sense of direction because of the complicated architecture. Therefore, the Indoor Maps is a critical function to help students find the destination inside the building.</p>

									<h3>Customized Searching</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Most of the online maps provide various choices of transportation. But few of them are customized for special needs. For example, Campus Maps provides feature searching for accessibility and safety, but the information is not enough and unclear. Therefore, I will add further details and explanations to each searching feature to let the users know how do they work. And the users will be able to search the route by the hashtags and see how the other arrive at the same destination. </p>

									<h3>Sharing Routes</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Upon my observation and interviews, people tend to stick to the first path they found to get to the classroom. Most people will not spend extra time to explore. However, there is almost always more than one way to get to the destination. Some people are good at finding shortcuts, and some choose the path based on personal reasons. The current system we have now does not provide a platform to share the useful information. Thus, recording and sharing the route with others become one important feature in my App. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was satisfied that many peers gave me positive feedback on my idea and confessed that they never thought about improving the condition or that there was even a problem. The thing we think is petty affects our life without our notice. A small problem such as having obstacle for finding the classroom can be deeper when we investigate the problem closely. People endure what they have at hand. The stress of life is accumulated from all the little endurances we have in daily life. By talking to people and making them facing those delicate aspects of life, people inspect their own life at the same time, which I find valuable.</p>
