					<p>-My story for leveling play field for the homeless kids-</p>
					<p>Many has been done to support homeless youth to get back to school and complete their education. However, scattering information and resource holds by different organizations and the vulnerable relationship among the school, the NGOs, and the children hamper the learning environment which is already unstable for homeless kids. How to maintain the consistency of the education for the homeless kids is difficult. In this project, we come up with a digital platform for making solid connection among the stakeholders.

						<h2>My Role</h2>
					<h3>Skill Set: Teamwork | Interview | Brainstorming | Sketching | Wireframing</h3></header>
					<p>I worked on this project for the CHI competetion within a 5-people team at first. I conducted interviews, analyze findings to provide insights, and drew wireframe.

					<hearder><h2>Define the Problem</h2></hearder>
						<p>Our original goal was to help homeless children access to education. After doing research, we discovered that there is a comprehensive system cooperated by the community and NGOs to help homeless children get back to school. However, few has been done after enrollments. Thus we refined the design problem and focused on "how to support homeless kids to achieve academic success."</p>
						<p>After talking to 5 related professionals in NGOs and academic fields, we targeted our users to be tutors at after school program, teachers at school, and parents.</p>

					<header><h2>Discover Needs</h2></header>
						<p>The <strong>background research</strong> indicates that most of the NGOs focus on supporting homeless families. The education related efforts are mainly made for getting kids back to formal education at school under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. </p> 
						<p>Kids' academic performance is not prioritized. After conducting 4 <strong>interviews</strong> with 3 institutes: Education Project, Alpha House, and Avalon Housing, we discovered that the main extra educational supports kids can have outside of the school is the afterschool program provided by few NGOs. But the program encountered difficulties of lacking: 
						<ol>
							<li>Common ground between the school and the voluntary tutors-Though the tutors want to help, they do not have enough information for what homework the kids have.</li>
							<li>Consistent connection between different parties-The liaisons and the tutors at the organization may change frequently, and the prior connection with the parents or schools breaks easily when people change.</li>
							<li>Communication channels-teachers at school need extra efforts such as emails and phonecall-the difficulties the educators encounterto correctly identify their needs and ensure proper placement.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
						The discovers shows that there is a need for further educational support that focusing on constructing a better connection among educators in order to provide stable learning environment to improve the kids' academic performance.</p>

					<header><h2>Design Process</h2></header>
						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Huge Scope 
								<p>After doing the research anf interviews, we discovered that there are so many stakeholders involved and the education of homeless children is a broad topic that can be tackled with many angles. We thus refined our design problem statement many times in order to make the design practical.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								Technology Limitation
								<p>Homeless family have limited access to technology. And after interviews, we understand that most of the parents have cellphones but not computers. And thus our final solution is an app based on cellphone.</p>
								
							</li>
							<li>
								Privacy
								<p>The education information is protected by the regulation, and thus though it might be helpful to share the educational history of the children in order for educators to identify obstacles and provide supports, it is not allowed to do so. Thus our design will only share the information about kid's assigment needed to be completed. No grades or learning history will be shared. </p>

					<h2>Final Solution: BridgED</h2>

					<p>The key concept of our final design is a unified platform which can let parents, teachers, and afterschool program tutors tracking the assignment and connected with each other easily. The main features include “unified login”, “indoor maps”, “customized searching”, and “sharing routes.”</p>

					<h2>Walk Through Main Features</h2>
					<h3>Unified Login</h3>
					<p>
						Every UM student has a pair of account and password to log in the school system. And it is also the key to the Google account. Therefore, to avoid duplicated login on different platforms, my App "Get U M" will provide a unified login page that users can use UM web login page to log in the system. The system will automatically connect to user's Wolverine access for the user's course schedule and import it to the Google calendar. Thus, the user will see the personal Google calendar on the screen. By clicking on the schedule, the system will direct the user to the location information. It is all-in-one, so the user will not have to jump back and forth between Wolverine access and Google Maps.
					</p>

					<h3>Indoor Maps</h3>
					<p>According to the user research, the biggest problem for finding the classroom is not how to get to the building. People usually do not have problems finding directions outside. The outdoor maps are thorough to some extent with the assistance provided by Google Maps and Campus Maps. But the problem happens when students are inside the building and totally lose their sense of direction because of the complicated architectural structures. Therefore, the Indoor Maps is a critical function to help students find the destination inside the building.</p>


					<h3>Customized Searching</h3>
					<p>Most of the online maps provide various choices of transportations. But seldom of them is customized for special needs. As a better example, Campus Maps provides feature searching for accessibility and safety. Nevertheless, the information is still not enough and unclear. Therefore, I will add further details and explanations to each searching feature to let the users know how do they work. And the users will be able to search the route by the hashtags and see how the other arrive at the same destination. </p>

					<h3>Sharing Routes</h3>
					<p>Upon my observation and interviews, people tend to stick to the first path they found to get to the classroom. Most people will not spend extra time to explore. However, there is almost always more than one way to get to the destination. Some people are good at finding shortcuts, and some choose the path based on personal reasons. The current system we have now does not provide a platform to share the useful information. Thus, recording and sharing the route with others become one important feature in my App. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was satisfied that many schoolmates gave me the positive feedbacks to my idea and confessed that they never thought about improving the condition or even never saw the problem. The thing we think is petty affects our life without our notice. A small problem such as having obstacle for finding the classroom can be deeper when we investigate the problem closely. But I can see how people endure what they have at hand. The stress of life is accumulated from all the little endurances we have in daily life. By talking to people and making them facing those delicate aspects of life, people inspect their own life at the same time, which I found it valuable.</p>
