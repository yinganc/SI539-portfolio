					<h3>September to December, 2016</h3>
					<p>-A helper for UM newcomers to find their way-</p>
					<p>GET U M is an App that provides navigation for UM students to find the location on campus. The design philosophy of this project focuses mainly on the attempts of decreasing the anxiety and the “outsider” feeling within new coming students by helping them find the locations efficiently.

					<h3>Skill Set: Interview | Brainstorming | Competitive Analysis | Sketching | Storyboarding | Persona | Paper Prototype | User Testing | Hi-fi Prototype with Adobe XD</h3></header>
					<p>I worked on this individual design project in the course: Introduction to Interaction Design. I experimented and iterated through the comprehensive design process introduced by Jon Kolko: “Define, Discover, Synthesize, Construct, Refine, and Reflect.”

					<hearder><h2>Define the Problem</h2></hearder>
					<p>New coming UM students are easy to get lost on campus when they are finding their classrooms. Having difficulties for finding locations can drive them crazy and bring more stress to their lives.</p>
					<p> After talking to <strong>6</strong> potential <strong>target users</strong> and doing the <strong> competitive analysis</strong>, I found that the existed tools are not customized enough to assist students to find their classrooms. People endure the situation with limited choices of tools. Every new UM student unavoidably experiences the anxiety for getting lost on campus.</p>

					<header><h2>Discover Needs</h2></header>
						<p>By conducting the <strong>interviews</strong> with <strong>6</strong> new coming students, I found a general pattern of finding locations and the commmon obstacles people encounters:
						<ol>
							<li>Scattered and incomprehensive location information on different platforms</li>
							<li>Complicated structure of the building</li>
							<li>Uncomforts for asking directions from strangers</li>
							<li>Extra time waistes for finding directions</li>
						</ol>
						</p>
						<p>Due to the belief that things will get better while time goes without considering the anxiety new UM students have to endure, the needs of UM students for finding accurate location is neglected.</p>

					<header><h2>Design Process</h2></header>
						<h3>Approach</h3>					  
					    <p>The main design approach I used was user-centered design. I focused on the users so the devices can meet the needs of people who are going to use them. </p>

					    <h3>Balance between Convergent and Divergent Thinking</h3>
    					
    					<ul>
    					<li>Convergent: Start
    					<p>My initial idea is an App that is customized for UM new coming students, which should be more powerful in finding classroom specifically.</p></li>

    					<li>Divergent: Brainstorming
    					<p>I then drew all the possibilities that came up to my mind and disccussed those ideas with target users.</p>

    					<li>Convergent: Focus Users
    						<p>I talked to more focused users with my storyboards. Through the interviews, users let me know that most of them were familiar with Google Maps and GPS function on their cell-phones. Therefore, my idea converged again to my original idea of creating an App. Then I created the persona accordingly. The process helped me modify the details and provides more solid features for my App.</p>

    					<li>Divergent: Expanded Features with User Testings
    						<p>I did 3 versions of low-fidelity paper prototypes in total. With user testings, I re-organized the order of the buttons and re-phrased the instructions according to the feedbacks, and kept refined my design and ended up with this version:</p>

    					<li>Convergent: Finalizing Solution with User Testings
    					
    						<p>Through the iteration process, I ended up with several high-fidelity prototype created by Adobe XD. The hi-fi prototype created more senses of reality while doing the user testing. The feedbacks from this stage reflected more details about the features.</p>

					<h2>Final Solution: Get U M</h2>

					<p>The key concept of my final design is a unified platform which gathers all the information related to student’s personal academic schedule and classroom locations. The main features include “unified login”, “indoor maps”, “customized searching”, and “sharing routes.”</p>

									<h3>Unified Login</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Every UM student has a pair of account and password to log in the school system. And it is also the key to the Google account. Therefore, to avoid duplicated login on different platforms, my App "Get U M" will provide a unified login page that users can use UM web login page to log in the system. The system will automatically connect to user's Wolverine access for the user's course schedule and import it to the Google calendar. Thus, the user will see the personal Google calendar on the screen. By clicking on the schedule, the system will direct the user to the location information. It is all-in-one, so the user will not have to jump back and forth between Wolverine access and Google Maps.</p>

									<h3>Indoor Maps</h3>
								</header>
								<p>According to the user research, the biggest problem for finding the classroom is not how to get to the building. People usually do not have problems finding directions outside. The outdoor maps are thorough to some extent with the assistance provided by Google Maps and Campus Maps. But the problem happens when students are inside the building and totally lose their sense of direction because of the complicated architectural structures. Therefore, the Indoor Maps is a critical function to help students find the destination inside the building.</p>
								
							</article>

							<article class="from-left">
							
								<header>
									<h3>Customized Searching</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Most of the online maps provide various choices of transportations. But seldom of them is customized for special needs. As a better example, Campus Maps provides feature searching for accessibility and safety. Nevertheless, the information is still not enough and unclear. Therefore, I will add further details and explanations to each searching feature to let the users know how do they work. And the users will be able to search the route by the hashtags and see how the other arrive at the same destination. </p>
								
							</article>

							<article class="from-right">
								
								<header>
									<h3>Sharing Routes</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Upon my observation and interviews, people tend to stick to the first path they found to get to the classroom. Most people will not spend extra time to explore. However, there is almost always more than one way to get to the destination. Some people are good at finding shortcuts, and some choose the path based on personal reasons. The current system we have now does not provide a platform to share the useful information. Thus, recording and sharing the route with others become one important feature in my App. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was satisfied that many schoolmates gave me the positive feedbacks to my idea and confessed that they never thought about improving the condition or even never saw the problem. The thing we think is petty affects our life without our notice. A small problem such as having obstacle for finding the classroom can be deeper when we investigate the problem closely. People endure what they have at hand. The stress of life is accumulated from all the little endurances we have in daily life. By talking to people and making them facing those delicate aspects of life, people inspect their own life at the same time, which I found it valuable.</p>
