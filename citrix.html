					<h2>Secure Mail: Holistic Competitive Analysis</h2>
					<h3>May to August, 2017</h3>
						<p>-Product Design Research Internship (NDA)-</p>
						<p>Secure Mail was receiving complaints from the customers. The team was trying to redesign the app but didn't have enough information to move on and make effective improvements. I came in to help identify use cases and understand the relative position with Secure Mail competitors in the current market.</p>
						<p> Working as a design research intern at Citrix for 12 weeks, I was treated as a full-time UX researcher and led the research. I enjoyed working with designers, researchers, project and program managers, and engineers. The experience was amazing but also challenging. 
						<p>Due to NDA, I appropriated the confidential information, but it wouldn't affect me to share my thoughts, personal experience, and what I had learned with you.</p>

					<p>To lead my own research, I planned the study, wrote screener and study guides, executed gap analysis and 20 in-lab studies, analyzed data, and produced oral and written report in a presentational format.

						<p>Secure Mail is an enterprise-based email app from Citrix. It receives complaints from users and has a hard time competing with its competitors. The research I conducted was trying to: 
							<ol>
								<li>guide the redesign effort</li>
								<li>discover common user cases</li>

					<header><h2>Muti-tasking Process</h2></header>
						<p>For gap analysis, I created a table that noted down all the good and special parts of features and UI, which could help designers understand what and which app we could learn from. While working on the gap analysis, I wrote screener for the vendor to recruit participants for the experience testing in the meantime. </p>

						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6">
						<p>With the gap analysis, I had a deeper understanding about our competitors and thus when I was writing the study guide for my experience testing, I had a more vivid idea of what I needed to ask and what kind of tasks I wanted to see the participants perform. </p>
						
						
						<p>During the experience testing sessions, I was a moderator, a notetaker, and an operator at the same time. I had to observe, asked questions, control the time and keep track with vendors for the next participant's schedule.</p>

						<p>After 20 experience testing sessions, I collected enough qualitative data for analysis. I went through the notes, analyzed data, and created a report in powerpoint format with actionable design recommendations so I could present to the product design team.</p>

					<header><h2>Lessons</h2></header>
					<p>I encountered many technical difficulties, such as internet disconnection or lateness of participants that cause the delay of all the following sessions. </p>
					<p>
						I learned mostly about how to be flexible and calm when there was something went wrong. For instance, I learned how to get the information that I want from users in chaotic circumstances. I also learned how to make participants relax and how to avoid misleading questions so participants would be willing to tell more about their feelings. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I observed that most people don't want to make others feel bad. Thus, when they were saying something negative, they became more hesitant. I needed to keep telling them that I wanted them to be candid to have their true feelings.

					<header><h2>Reflection</h2></header>
					<p>At school, we always emphasize on processes. But working in the industry, I learned that the most important thing is the result. Thinking about how to present, what the results can be, and how the designers digest the information is very important. And that's the reason why I found I should always start from a presentation instead of analyzing everything and deducting from a full analysis. </p>
						<p>When I was analyzing the data, I have all the insights and user flows in my mind. But when presenting to engineers and designers, they need to know the logic behind the design recommendations I made. Raw data is powerful. Quotes and recordings are the evidence that backs up the research.  </p>
