					<h2>Secure Mail: Benchmarking Research</h2>
					<h3>May to August, 2017</h3>
						<p>-Product Design Research Internship (NDA)-</p>
						<p>Secure Mail was an enterprise-based email app from Citrix. It received complaints from users and had a hard time competing with its competitors. The team was trying to redesign the app but didn't have enough information to move on and make effective improvements. I came in to help identify use cases and understand the market positioning of Secure Mail among its competitors.</p>
						<p>Working as a design research intern at Citrix for 12 weeks, I was treated as a full-time UX researcher and led the research. I enjoyed working with designers, researchers, project/program managers, and engineers. The experience was amazing.</p>

				<hearder><h2>Plan</h2></hearder>
				<p>I planned the research and divided it into two phases:</p>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Gap Analysis with 10 Competitors on iPhone and Android phone:<br>
						To understand the trends of features, gestures, and layouts of current designs in the market from the competitors</li>
						<li>Experience Testing with 20 Participants:<br>
						To define common use cases and to learn good user experience and desirable features for a good email app</li>

					<header><h2>Process</h2></header>
					<h3>Gap Analysis</h3>
						<p>I went through 10 competitors on iPhone and Android phone from downloading, setting up, to all the tasks such as emailing, scheduling, adding contacts, or changing settings, etc. Then I created a table that noted down my observation of features and UI of each competitor app.</p>
						<p style="font-style: italic;">Sample study artifacts: 
							<ul><li>Raw data for gap analysis</li></ul>
							 <img src="images/citrix/rawdata.png">
							 <ul><li>Final gap analysis table</li></ul>
							 <img src="images/citrix/finalgap.png">
						</p> 
						<p>While working on the gap analysis, I wrote screener for the vendor to recruit participants for the experience testing in the meantime. </p>

					<h3>User Experience Testing</h3>
					<h4>I. Study Design</h4>
					<p>With the gap analysis, I had a deeper understanding about our competitors and thus when I was writing the study guide for my experience testing, I had a more vivid idea of what I needed to ask and what kind of tasks I wanted to see the participants perform. </p>
					<p>After drafting the protocol, I reviewed it with the core team and did a pilot testing to make final adjustments before running the sessions.</p>
					<a href="images/citrix/samplestudyguide.pdf" target="_blank"><input style="margin-left: 17em;" type="button" value="Sample Study Guide" /></a>

					<h4>II. Execution</h4>
						
						<p>The original plan was to conduct 3 sessions in a day, and 30 sessions in total. However, we didn't recruit 30 participants at the end. Instead, we had 20. The number was in fact good enough for us to gather feedback and generate a report.</p> 
						<p>I, therefore, conducted 20 user experience testing and investigated on when and how the participants used their work email app daily, what they liked and disliked with the app, and what they found confusing with the interface.</p>

						</div>
					<h4>III. Data Analysis</h4>
						<p>
							I started from cleaning the raw data, which meant going back to the recordings, reading through the notes taken by different note takers, completed and fixed the missing data. 
						</p>
						<p style="font-style: italic;">Sample study artifacts: Notes from user testing
							<img src="images/citrix/ut_rawdata.png">
						</p>
							Then I used content coding and analysis to analyze the cleaned data and drafted the report.
						</p>

							<img src="images/citrix/contentanalysis.png">
						</p>
					<h3>Final Report and Impacts</h3>
						<p>The final report was a comprehensive competitive analysis that based on the findings from the gap analysis and the user experience testing. The findings were categorized into three different criteria:
						<ol>
							<li>Learnings from the competitors</li>
							<li>Findings for user behaviors and use cases</li>
							<li>Feedback on the experience with Secure Mail</li>
						</ol></p>
						<p>At the end of the report, the design recommendations were provided. The suggestions specified what parts of the user interfaces needed fixing and why.</p>

						</p>
						<p>The report was delivered to the product design team and the engineering team. The findings and recommendations helped prioritize features. The team could move on and redesign the app.</p>

					<header><h2>Lessons</h2></header>
					<p>
						<p>I encountered many issues while running the sessions such as:
							<ol>
								<li>Technical problems:
									<ul>
										<li>Server issues: the emails couldn't go through</li>
										<li>Connection issues: Vysor/Quicktime/GTM disconnected</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Participant issues:
									<ul>
										<li>Lateness</li>
										<li>Not qualified</li>
										<li>Dragging to overtime</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ol>

					<p>
						In those unexpected cases, I learned mostly about how to be flexible and calm when there was something went wrong. I learned how to get the information that I wanted from users in chaotic circumstances. I also learned how to make participants relax and how to avoid misleading questions so participants would be willing to tell more about their feelings. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I observed that most people didn't want to hurt others feeling. Thus, when they were saying something negative, they became more hesitant. I needed to remind them to be candid.

					<header><h2>Reflection</h2></header>
					<p>At school, we always emphasized on a process. But in the industrial context, a result was more important. Thinking about how to present and how the information could be digested helped me display the findings and recommendations effectively. Therefore, I found I should start creating the presentation before finishing data analysis. I should keep in mind that, though I had all the insights and user flows in my mind, engineers and designers needed to know the logic behind the design recommendations I made. </p>
					<p>Thus, I also felt the power of raw data. Quotes and recordings were the solid pieces of evidence that backed up the research.</p>
