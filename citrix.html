						<p>-User Research Project-</p>
						<p>Working as a research Intern at Citrix for 12 weeks, I was treated as a full-time UX researcher and led a UX research study on Secure Mail app to provided Product Design team actionable design recommendations and helped prioritize features. 
						<p>I enjoyed working with designers, researchers, project and program managers, and also people not from Product Design team such as engineers. I am proud to be part of the company and feel honored to contribute to improve a product that can help people improve their efficiency. Due to NDA, I am not able to describe my work in detail, but would like to share my thoughts, personal experience, and what I had learned with you.</p>

					<p>By leading a my own research, I planned the study, wrote screener and study guides, executed 20 in-lab studies, analyzed qualitative data, and produced final oral and written research report in a presentational format.

						<p>Secure Mail is an enterprise-based email app from Citrix. It receives complaints from users and has a hard time competing with its competitors. The research I conducted was trying to: 
							<ol>
								<li>guide the redesign effort</li>
								<li>discover common user cases</li>
							</ol>

					<header><h2>Muti-tasking Process</h2></header>
						<p>I worked on gap analysis first and at the mean time, I wrote screener for the vendor to recruit participants for experience testing. My overall goal of the research was to guide the redesign effort of an app from the company. </p>
						<p>For gap analysis, I created a table that noted down all the good and special parts about features and UI, which could help designers understand what and which app we could learn from. By doing the gap analysis, I had a deep understanding about our competitors and thus when I was writing the study guide for my experience testing, I had a more vivid idea of what I needed to ask and what kind of tasks I wanted to see the participants perform. </p>

						<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6">
						
						<p>During the experience testing sessions, I encountered many technical difficulties that I had never encountered at schools, such as internet disconnection or lateness of participants that cause the delay of the next session. From all the difficulties, I learned mostly about how to be flexible and calm when there was something went wrong in the session in order to still get the information that you want. I also learned how to make participants relax and how to avoid misleading questions so participants were willing to tell you more about their feelings. I observed that most people didn't want to make you feel bad. Thus, when they were saying something bad, they became more hesitant, so I needed to keep telling them that I wanted them to be candid and tell me about their true feelings. </p>

					<header><h2>Final</h2></header>
					<p>After 20 experience testing sessions, I collected enough qualitative data for analysis, my mentor then asked me to use content coding method to still do some qualitative data analysis for some part of the data. I then created my report in power point format so I could present to the product design team. My findings were divided into three parts, first was behavioral findings that include the common use cases, the second part was about the things we could learn from other competitors, and the third part was about what we could learn from the feedback collected during the session testing on our own product.</p>

					<header><h2>Reflection</h2></header>
					<p>From data analysis and presentation, I learned that working at a company, the most important thing was the result. I should always start from presentation instead of analyzing everything and deducting from a full analysis. Thinking about how people could digest my findings and design recommendations were what I have learned the most. When I was analyzing the data, I have all the insights and the user flows in my head, but when presenting to engineers and designers, they needed more logical formation and numbers in order to understand how I came up with those design recommendations. </p>
						<p>This was the first time I analyzed a huge amount of qualitative data and understood the method besides affinity diagram. I am very grateful and I feel more confident to join the enterprise based tech company. The internship help me to know more about my own interests. I now know that I do have great interests in doing user research. </p>
