					<h3>February, 2018</h3>
						<p>-Agile User Research (NDA)-</p>
						<p>This is an extended project from my <a href="citrix.html">internship at Citrix</a>. Based on the identified use cases and the competitive analysis I did last summer, the Product Design team redesigned the Secure Mail app. The new UI needed a quick validation to see if it met the users needs. 
						I led 6 user testing to verify the new design concept. The research was done in 1 week and the report was delivered to the international Citrix Secure Mail team.

						<h2>My Role</h2>
					<h3>Skill Set: Agile Research Study | Design Concept Validation | User Testing | Content Coding</h3></header>
					<p>I worked with a vendor for user recruitment. And I led the study, including designing the study, moderating the user testing sessions, analyzing data, writing the report and holding the meeting for the findings and recommnedations readout.
					</p>

					<hearder><h2>Goal</h2></hearder>
						<p>Secure Mail is an enterprise-based email app from Citrix. It was redesigned based on the feedback gathered from the <a href="citrix.html">previous research</a>. The research goal was to validate the new navigation design concept to see if it met the users needs. The team planned to launch the new user interface in Q1, and thus the research schedule became really tight.</p>

				<hearder><h2>Agile Process</h2></hearder>
				<h3>I. Challenge: Tight Schedule</h3>
				<p>While I was doing another research for another product, this urgent research request popped out. The team tried to validate the design before Q1 development and the deadline was in a week. The kick-off meeting need to be held immediately and the research project manager and the team helped me squeeze it into my research schedule.					
				<img src="images/SMusertesting/timeline.png">	
				</p>
				<h3>II. Concern: Recruitment</h3>
				<!-- <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6"> -->
					
					<p>The main concern was the user recruitment. Recruiting 6 participants in 5 days including a weekend was very chanllenging. I therefore created the screener and contacted the vendor immediately once we accepted the research request. Gladly, our vendor worked closely with us and found the users efficiently.</p>
					<!-- <p>The screener can be downloaded below. But due to NDA, the screener was modified and it was a sample instead of the one I used for this project.</p> -->	

					
				<!-- </div> -->
				<!-- <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6"> -->
					<p>The main criteria for the participants for this study was similar to the criteria for Secure Mail User Experience Testing Study:
						<ul>
							<li>Checks work email and work calendar on a mobile email app</li>
							<li>Does not work for Citrix or other competitor companies</li>
							<li>Be able to participate in a 30-minute in-person session in Santa Clara</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<!-- <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.7em;">Note that the red words were instructiobs for the recruiter</p> -->

				<!-- </div> -->
				<h3>III. Communication: Study Guide</h3>
				<!-- <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6">					 -->
					<p>I reviewed the wireframes first and worked closely with the designers to understand what they wanted to test and in which part of the design they were lack of confidence or had assumptions that wanted to validate. By understanding their design thinking and the logic behind, it was easier and faster for me to draft the study protocol.</p>

				<!-- <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6">					 -->
					<p>The main tasks:
						<ul>
							<li>Compose</li>
							<li>Calendar</li>
							<li>Contact</li>
							<li>Account</li>
							<li>Attachment</li>
							<li>Setting</li>

					</p>

				<h3>IV. Execution: Back to Back Sessions</h3>
				<!-- <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6"> -->
					<p>To conduct 6 user testing in one day, the time for preparation or debriefing between each session was very short. Note takers also did not have enough time to clear their notes before submitting. Fast and short discussion for portocol modification became primary for utilizing the time. Designers, as my observers, gave me feedback and I would add or cut several questions based on what they had learned. </p>
				<!-- </div> -->
				<!-- <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6"> -->
					<p>In this agile process, good notes became more important. It was the primary resource I would use for the report, not the session recordings. Good notes would save my time for data analysis. And a well designed note-taking sheet assisted my session observers to take informative notes.</p>
					<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/KslmoPpWbwGbBYXs1" target="_blank"><input style="margin-left: 16em;" type="button" value="Sample Note Taking Form" /></a>

				<!-- </div> -->
					

				<h3>V. Data Analysis and Report Creating</h3>
				<!-- <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6">	 -->
					<p>With Google sheet exported from the note taking form, I can easily track how many participants achieved success for a certain task at their first attemption, and how many participants failed the tasks. With content coding, I have solid numbers to backup my findings. Also, by reading through notes, I found users from diverse background gave some unified feedback regarding some specific tasks. The patterns were clear and some influential quotes can be found and used in the report to synthesize and provide suggestions to the design team before they move on toward development stage. </p>

					<header><h2>Impact</h2></header>
						<p>Due to NDA, detail findings cannot be shared and the next step for the team is confidentail. But here are some broader implications to the team that I would like to share:
							<ul>
								<li>The team decided not to implement some new experimental design concepts according to the user feedback since they created too much confusion.</li>
								<li>Before providing any new features, the team would go back and stayed with some part of the old design for the current features provided.</li>
							</ul>
						A further study for a specific tab in the app would be part of the next step and a new feature would be officially brought to the future discussion.

					<header><h2>Reflection</h2></header>
					<p>With my <a href="citrix.html">internship experience</a>, I was familiar with the team and the product. It helped me start quickly and moved fast throughout the process. Everything went smoothly and besides the recruitment, the study was conducted and finished in 3 days.</p>
					<p> Besides my own improvement, I also noticed that the recruitment was a huge variable in the research process. I encountered great difficulties for the study in my internship, and one of the reason was because of the unsmooth communication with the vendor for recruitment. But this time, the vendor worked closely with me and the participants were all qualified and on-time. From my side, I learned from the last experience that the time estimation need to clude more buffers. I found that was also a reason why I could conduct back-to-back sessions smoothly this time.</p>
					<p> Now I understood I am capable to design, execute, and deliver the research results in a short period of time. </p>
