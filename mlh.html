					<h3>September-December, 2016</h3>
					
					<p>-This is my story about providing solutions to better the  workflow of MLHP.-</P>
					<p>Michigan Legal Help Program (MLHP), a non-profit organization, provides fruitful resources for Michigan residents who are involved in civil cases on their official website. They encounter increasing pressures for uploading new content with their current workflow as the website grows quickly in content as well as the number of the visitors. Thus, MLHP asked us for help on their planned improvement.

						<h2>My Roles</h2>
					<h3>Skill Set: Research | Interview | Affinity Wall | Brainstorming | Consultant Report Writing | Teamwork | Presentation</h3></header>
					<p>I worked on this project for the course called "Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Fundations" within a 4-person team. For outreach activities, I led communications with clients and worked as a liaison. Internally, I was also one of the researchers and interviewers. 
					</p>

					<header><h2>Approaches</h2>
						<h3>Overarching Question: How Can We Improve the Workflow for Uploading New Content to the Website?</h3></header>
						<ul>
					    <li><h3>Background Research</h3>
						<p>
						We approached the question from different angles. I did literature review on one of the aspects, the content management system (CMS).
						This approach was necessary to help us perpare the interview portocols and have the background knowledge before conduting interviews.
						For the background research report I wrote on CMS: <a href="images/CMS_Background Research Report.pdf" target="_blank">Open in PDF</a></p></li>
						

						<li><h3>Contextual Interviews</h3>
						<p>My team conducted 5 contextual interviews with the whole content management team at MLHP. One teammate and I were responsible for 2 interviews and 1 observation of their monthly content meetings. This process was helpful for us to understand the practice of their current workflow in the real context of their work. 
						</p></li>
						

						<li><h3>Affinity Wall</h3>
						<p>We made affinity diagrams by putting our affinity notes taken from the interviews on the post-it notes. And categorized all the post-it notes on the paper wall. The process of labeling each cluster of notes with summaries and category titles helped us to see the whole picture and understand the core of MLH's problem.</p>

					<header><h2>Discoveries</h2>
					<h3>Core Problem: Uneven Work Distribution Caused the Bottleneck</h3></header>
					<li><h3>What's Good?</h3></li>
					<p>MLHP has a strong preference towards physical files and are doing well with their physcial documentation. Their satisfaction towards paper folders led us to prioritize a paper-based tool as one of the final solutions.</p>
					<li><h3>What's Bad?</h3></li>		
					<ol>
					<li><p>There was no united platform for communication. It was uneasy to get everyone on the same page.</p></li>
					<li><p>There was no deadlines for uploading new content. People found it hard to complete their work without knowing their priorities and deadlines.</p></li>
					<li><p>The decision making power was very centralized. One of the content management team members had too much on her plate, and thus the workflow clogged when it came to that person.</p></li>

						<h3>How to Get to the Solution?</h3>
					</header>
					<ul>
					<li><h3>Brainstorming</h3>
					<p>
						We presented our discoveries in class, and invited the whole class (more than a hundred students) to brainstorm possible solutions with us. One of our classmates suggested using Kanban to visualize the workflow.

					</li> 


					<li><h3>Walking Through the Affinity Wall</h3>
					<p>We brought our affinity wall to class and invited our classmates to walk through the wall, read the notes, and discuss the rationale of the summaries and categories. In this way we could learn from different perspectives, from those that have never talked to our clients before.</p></li>

					<header><h2>Solutions and Impacts</h2></header>
					<p>
						In our final presentation to the client, we presented 4 scenario-based solutions to them. The main solution is the physical Kanban, which is easy to use, cheap, and effective. I was responsible for introducing this main solution and the clients gave me a very positive response. </p>

						<blockquote>"I was worried about that I would need to learn a new digital tool with your suggestion. But now that I understand that the problem can be solved with papers, I am so relieved."--MLHP Staff</blockquote>
					<p>
						I could see how the clients were highly appreciative of the idea. They immediately implemented this solution and was very satisfied.
