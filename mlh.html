					<h3>September-December, 2016</h3>
					
					<p>-This is my story about providing solutions to better of the workflow.-</P>
					<p>Michigan Legal Help Program (MLHP) is a non-profit organization that provides fruitful resources for Michigan residents who are involved in civil cases on their official website. They encounter increasing pressures for uploading new contents with their current workflow when the website grows quickly in contents and as well as the number of the visitors. Thus, MLHP asks for helps for the improvement.

						<h2>My Roles</h2>
					<h3>Skill Set: Research | Interview | Affinity Wall | Brainstorming | Consultant Report Writing | Teamwork | Presentation</h3></header>
					<p>I worked on this project for the course called "Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Fundations" within a 4-people team. For outreach activities, I led communications with clients and worked as a liaison. Internally, I was also one of the researchers and interviewers with members.

					<header><h2>Approaches</h2>
						<h3>Overarching Question: How to Improve Workflow for Uploading New Content on to the Website?</h3></header>
					    <li><h3>Background Research</h3></li>
						<p>
						We approached the question from different angles. I did literature review on one of the aspects, which was content management system (CMS).
						This approach was necessary to help us perpare the interview portocols and have the background knowledge before conduting interviews.
						For the background research report I wrote on CMS: <a href="images/CMS_Background Research Report.pdf" target="_blank">Open in PDF</a></p>
						

						<li><h3>Contextual Interviews</h3></li>
						<p>My team conducted 5 contextual interviews with the whole content management team at MLHP. One teammate and I were responsible for 2 interviews and 1 observation on their monthly content meeting. The process is helpful for us to understand the practice of the current workflow in the real context. 
						</p>
						

						<li><h3>Affinity Wall</h3></li>
						<p>We made affinity diagrams by putting our affinity notes taken from the interviews on the posted notes. And categorized all the posted notes on the paper wall. By labeling each cluster of the notes with summaries, this process help us to see the whole picture and understand the core of the problem.</p>

					<header><h2>Discoveries</h2>
					<h3>Core Problem: Uneven Work Distribution Caused the Bottleneck</h3></header>
					<li><h3>What's Good?</h3></li>
					<p>MLHP have strong preference towards physical files and are doing well with their physcial documentation. Their satisfaction towards paper folders led us prioritized the paper-based tool as one of the final solutions.</p>
					<li><h3>What's Bad?</h3></li>		
					<ol>
					<li><p>There was no united platform for communication. It was uneasy to get everyone on the same page.</p></li>
					<li><p>There was no deadlines for uploading new contents. People found it hard to complete their work without knowing the priorities and deadlines.</p></li>
					<li><p>The decision making power was very centralized. One of the content management team members had too much on her plate, and thus the workflow clogged when it came to the person.</p></li>

						<h3>How to Get to the Solution?</h3>
					</header>
					<ul>
					<li><h3>Brainstorming</h3>
					<p>
						We presented our discovers in class, and invited the whole class, more than a hundred students, to brainstormed the solution with us. One of our classmates suggested using Kanban to visualize the workflow.
					
						<a href="images/fulls/01.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/thumbs/01.jpg" title="The Anonymous Red" alt="" /></a></p></li>


					<li><h3>Walking Through the Affinity Wall</h3>
					<p>We brought the affinity wall to class and invited our classmates to walk through the wall, read the notes, and discuss the rationale of the summaries and categories. In this way we could learn from different perspectives, from whom have never talked to our clients before.</p></li>

					<header><h2>Solutions and Impacts</h2></header>
					<p>
						In our final presentation to the client, we presented 4 scenario-based solutions to them. The main solution is the physical Kanban, which is easy to use, cheap, and effective. I was responsible to introduce this main solution and the clients gave me a very possitive response. </p>

						<blockquote>"I was worried about to learn a new digital tool after your suggestion. But when I understand the problem can be solved by papers, I am so relief."--Miss C in MLHP</blockquote>
					<p>
						I could see how the clients were highly appreciate the idea. They immediately implemented this solution and was very satisfied.</p>
